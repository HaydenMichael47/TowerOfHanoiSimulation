Description and How to Use
==========================
1. TowerOfHanoi.py simulates how to solve the Tower of Hanoi 
problem recursively. Stacks are used to hold the "disks", and 
the method will output print statements showing where each disk
should be placed. To run, hit run and a prompt will ask for a number.
Enter an integer and hit enter. The program will push that many
"disks" onto a stack and call the towerOfHanoi method with the 
given size. To do more testing, hit run and enter a different 
number.
